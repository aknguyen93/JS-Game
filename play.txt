Setup required:
- var for user start location
- var for treasure location
  - not the same!
- var for user current location
- game board
  - var for each block
  - track by x and y
- vars for direction (N, E, W, S)
- var for previous user location

Game play:
- Start with a prompt, telling user about adventure
  - collect their name
- while !treasureFound
  - ask what direction they want to go in
  - tell user if treasure is in their new location
  - check that they've entered a valid direction
  - only prompt for valid directions
  - make sure their move is still within the grid
  - do math, figure user's current location 
    - (change x or y value)
